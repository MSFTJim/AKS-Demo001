ASP.NET Core Test App for AKS Deployment project

This is a sample ASP.NET Core MVC App.  The app itself is not important.  Its just one of the samples apps available that I use so i can have somehting to deploy to AKS.

The app has ben packaged into a container

The container loaded into ACR and an AKS cluster has been created connected to that ACR

A Deployment YAML was created to deploy the app and a service

most recently, a namespace was added
